    "2. Also, double check you have the right kind of API token with the right permissions. You should find it on [this webpage](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and it should show with Permissions of \"All\". If not, try creating another key by:\n",
    "- Pressing \"Create new secret key\" on the top right\n",
    "- Select **Owned by:** you, **Project:** Default project, **Permissions:** All\n",
    "- Click Create secret key, and use that new key in the code and the `.env` file (it might take a few minutes to activate)\n",
    "- Do a Kernel >> Restart kernel, and execute the cells in this Jupyter lab starting at the top\n",
    "4. As a fallback, replace the line `openai = OpenAI()` with `openai = OpenAI(api_key=\"your-key-here\")` - while it's not recommended to hard code tokens in Jupyter lab, because then you can't share your lab with others, it's a workaround for now\n",

There are many ways around this that some of you might be familiar with. For example, Selenium is a hugely popular framework that runs a browser behind the scenes, renders the page, and allows you to query it. If you have experience with Selenium, Playwright or similar, then feel free to improve the Website class to use them. Please push your code afterwards so I can share it with other students!"
